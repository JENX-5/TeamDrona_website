TEAM MEMBER PHOTOS — Where to put images
========================================

Put each team member's photo in this folder:

  public/team/

Use the same filename as in public/data/team.json for each member's "image" field.

Example: if team.json has  "image": "person1.jpg"
         then save the photo as:  public/team/person1.jpg

Recommended: square or portrait, at least 300x300 px.
Formats: jpg, jpeg, png, webp
